# hello-world

Hello, crazy people!

We are living through a crazy time. Many of us have more time to think, examine our lives and the world we live in, and create change in areas we dislike. I am going zero-waste, and am attempting to learn more about the world I call my home. 

I am seeing more change than I had previously. I wonder if this is why.

Many of us are wondering how we got into this mess. We are wondering how we can prevent future messes.

In addition, many problems are connected. In this way are the huge web of problems connected to us. We can choose to start climbing out of the web, or we can contribute to it. 

What have you crazy humans been doing recently in this crazy world?
